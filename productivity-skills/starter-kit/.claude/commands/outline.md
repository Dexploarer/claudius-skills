# How to Build Better Habits in 2025

## I. Introduction
   A. Hook: "You don't rise to your goals, you fall to your systems"
   B. Problem: Most people rely on motivation (fleeting)
   C. Thesis: Habit systems > willpower

## II. Understanding Habit Formation
   A. The Habit Loop
      1. Cue - trigger that initiates behavior
      2. Routine - behavior itself
      3. Reward - benefit from behavior
   B. Why habits are powerful
      1. Automatic (save mental energy)
      2. Compound over time
   C. Common myths about habits
      1. "Takes 21 days" (actually 66 on average)
      2. "Need massive motivation"

## III. The 4 Laws of Behavior Change
   A. Make it Obvious
      1. Implementation intentions
      2. Environment design
      3. Example: Gym clothes by bed
   B. Make it Attractive
      1. Temptation bundling
      2. Join culture where behavior is normal
      3. Example: Audiobooks only at gym
   C. Make it Easy
      1. 2-minute rule
      2. Reduce friction
      3. Example: Pre-cut vegetables
   D. Make it Satisfying
      1. Immediate rewards
      2. Habit tracking
      3. Example: Check mark on calendar

## IV. Building Your Habit System
   A. Start small (really small)
      1. 1 pushup, not 50
      2. 1 page, not 1 chapter
   B. Stack habits
      1. After [current habit], I will [new habit]
      2. Example: "After coffee, I write 100 words"
   C. Track progress
      1. Visual habit tracker
      2. Don't break the chain
   D. Plan for failure
      1. Never miss twice
      2. Get back on track quickly

## V. Common Pitfalls & Solutions
   A. Setting too many habits at once
      → Focus on 1-2 at a time
   B. Going too big too fast
      → Scale down to tiny habits
   C. Relying on motivation
      → Build systems instead
   D. Giving up after one failure
      → Progress, not perfection

## VI. Conclusion
   A. Recap: Systems > Goals
   B. Action items:
      1. Choose ONE habit to build
      2. Make it tiny
      3. Stack it with existing habit
      4. Track it daily
   C. Call to action: Start today, start tiny
   D. Closing thought: "Small changes, remarkable results"
