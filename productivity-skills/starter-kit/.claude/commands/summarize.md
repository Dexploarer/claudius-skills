Title: "The Future of AI in Healthcare"

SUMMARY:
Artificial intelligence is transforming healthcare through three main applications: diagnostics, treatment planning, and administrative efficiency.

Diagnostics: AI models now detect cancer, heart disease, and diabetic retinopathy with accuracy matching or exceeding human doctors. IBM Watson and Google DeepMind lead this space.

Treatment: Personalized medicine using AI to analyze patient genetics, history, and latest research to recommend optimal treatments. Reduced trial-and-error prescribing.

Administration: Automation of scheduling, billing, and record-keeping saves 15-20 hours/week per physician, allowing more patient care time.

Challenges remain: Data privacy, algorithm bias, regulatory approval, and doctor adoption resistance.

Outlook: AI won't replace doctors but augment their capabilities. Hospitals investing in AI infrastructure now will lead in 5-10 years.

Key stat: Healthcare AI market projected to grow from $6.7B (2021) to $67.4B (2027).
