## Design Principles:

1. **One idea per slide** - Don't overload
2. **Visual > Text** - Show, don't tell
3. **10-20-30 Rule** (Guy Kawasaki):
   - 10 slides max (for pitch)
   - 20 minutes max
   - 30pt font minimum
4. **Contrast and hierarchy** - Make important things big
5. **Consistent branding** - Colors, fonts, style

## Storytelling Framework:

**Situation** → **Complication** → **Resolution**

or

**What is** → **What could be** → **How to get there**

## Tips:

- Start with the end in mind (what action do you want?)
- Less is more (cut ruthlessly)
- Practice out loud (time yourself)
- Prepare for questions
- Have backup slides for deep dives

Ask the user about their presentation topic, audience, and goal to create a tailored outline.
