## Tips for effective agendas:

1. **Clear objectives** - Every agenda item has a purpose (decide, inform, discuss)
2. **Time-boxed** - Allocate realistic time to each topic
3. **Assign owners** - Who leads each discussion
4. **Send in advance** - 24-48 hours before meeting
5. **Prioritize** - Most important items first
6. **Leave buffer** - Don't pack the agenda too tight

Ask the user about the meeting purpose and create an appropriate agenda.
