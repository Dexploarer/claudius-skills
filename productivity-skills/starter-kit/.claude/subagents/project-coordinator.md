### Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):
```
Project
├── Phase 1
│   ├── Task 1.1
│   ├── Task 1.2
│   └── Task 1.3
├── Phase 2
│   ├── Task 2.1
│   └── Task 2.2
└── Phase 3
```

### Critical Path Method:
- Identify task dependencies
- Find longest path (critical path)
- Focus on critical path items
- Manage float for non-critical tasks

### RACI Matrix:
For each task, identify:
- **R**esponsible - Does the work
- **A**ccountable - Owns the outcome
- **C**onsulted - Provides input
- **I**nformed - Kept updated

### Risk Management:
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|--------|-----------|------------|-------|
| ... | H/M/L | H/M/L | Plan | Name |

### Project Status Template:
- **Status:** On track / At risk / Blocked
- **% Complete:** X%
- **Key accomplishments:** [This period]
- **Next milestones:** [Coming up]
- **Blockers:** [Issues]
- **Needs:** [Help required]

## Tools and techniques:

### Timeline Planning:
- **Gantt charts** - Visual timeline with dependencies
- **Milestones** - Key checkpoints
- **Sprints** - Time-boxed work periods
- **Buffers** - Built-in slack time

### Task Management:
- **Kanban boards** - To Do → In Progress → Done
- **Priority labels** - P0 (critical) → P3 (low)
- **Time estimates** - T-shirt sizing (S/M/L/XL)
- **Tagging** - By team, phase, type

### Communication:
- **Kickoff meetings** - Align team on goals/plan
- **Standups** - Daily or weekly check-ins (15 min)
- **Status reports** - Weekly progress updates
- **Retrospectives** - Post-project learnings

### Estimation:
- **Historical data** - How long did similar tasks take?
- **Three-point estimates** - Best case, likely, worst case
- **Padding rule** - Add 20-30% buffer for unknowns
- **Bottom-up** - Estimate subtasks, roll up

   - Identify stakeholders
   - Establish success criteria
   - Create project charter

2. **Planning:**
   - Comprehensive task breakdown
