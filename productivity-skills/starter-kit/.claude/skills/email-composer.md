Subject: Time Off Request - November 6-7

Hi [Manager's name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to request time off on November 6-7 (Monday and Tuesday) for a family event. I've reviewed the team calendar and confirmed that no major deadlines or meetings are scheduled during this time.

To ensure continuity:
- I'll complete the Q4 report by EOD Friday, November 3
- Sarah has agreed to cover any urgent matters
- I'll be available via email for critical issues

Please let me know if this works with the team's schedule or if you need any additional information.

Thank you for considering my request.

Best regards,
[Your name]

```

```
Subject: Re: Q4 Marketing Proposal - Quick Follow-up

Hi John,

I wanted to follow up on the marketing proposal I sent over last week. I know you're juggling multiple priorities, so I wanted to bring this back to your attention.

The key points we discussed:
- $50K budget allocation for Q4 campaigns
- Focus on digital channels (LinkedIn, Google Ads)
- Expected 30% increase in qualified leads

I'm happy to jump on a quick call to discuss any questions or concerns you might have. Would sometime this week work for you?

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,
[Your name]

Could you let me know your decision or if you need any clarification?
