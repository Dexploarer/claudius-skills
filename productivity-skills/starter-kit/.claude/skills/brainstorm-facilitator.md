- Hide important features 5 clicks deep → **Bring key features to surface**
- Ignore user feedback → **Create feedback loop and act on it**
- Make it complicated and confusing → **Simplify, simplify, simplify**

Research shows friendships form through repeated, unplanned interactions:

2. **Second contact:** Same group/place (deeper conversation)
3. **Third contact:** Suggest 1-on-1 ("Want to grab coffee?")

**Key:** You must make the ask. Don't wait for them.
