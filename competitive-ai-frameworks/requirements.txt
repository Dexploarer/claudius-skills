# Competitive AI Frameworks - Python Dependencies

# Core dependencies (minimal for basic functionality)
# Note: This framework is designed to work with Claude Code,
# which provides most functionality through its tools and subagents

# Data handling (for results and metrics)
# These are all standard library in Python 3.8+, included for reference

# Optional: For enhanced functionality

# Visualization (optional - only needed if --visualize flag is used)
# matplotlib>=3.5.0
# seaborn>=0.11.0

# Advanced metrics (optional)
# numpy>=1.21.0
# pandas>=1.3.0

# Testing (optional - for development)
# pytest>=7.0.0
# pytest-cov>=3.0.0

# Code analysis tools (optional - for more sophisticated scanning)
# bandit>=1.7.0  # Python security scanner
# pylint>=2.12.0  # Code quality checker
# radon>=5.1.0   # Code complexity metrics

# Note: The framework is designed to work with minimal dependencies
# All core functionality uses Python standard library only
# Install optional packages only if you need specific features
