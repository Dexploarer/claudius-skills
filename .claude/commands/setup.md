Help me set up a new project with best practices.

Ask me:
1. What type of project? (Node.js, Python, React, etc.)
2. What's the project name?
3. Do you want git initialized?
4. Do you want a README?
5. Do you want a .gitignore?
6. Do you want ESLint/Prettier or similar tools?

Then create the appropriate files and directory structure for this project type.
