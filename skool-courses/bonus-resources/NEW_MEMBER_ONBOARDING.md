## Common Beginner Questions

**Q: "I've never coded. Can I really build games?"**
A: YES! That's exactly why we use AI. It writes the code for you. Your job is to be creative and guide it. Members with ZERO coding experience have published games using our methods.

**Q: "Do I need to pay for anything?"**
A: The course and community are 100% free. Claude Code has a free tier. You might want to upgrade Claude eventually ($20/month) for unlimited usage, but you can start free.

**Q: "How long until I can build a real game?"**
A: Your first simple game: 1 hour. Your first impressive game: 1 week. Your first portfolio-worthy game: 1 month. Your first commercial game: 2-3 months. We're that fast with AI!

**Q: "What if I get stuck?"**
A: Post in #help. We have 500+ members and someone's usually online. Also, use AI itself - ask Claude Code "why isn't this working?"

**Q: "Can I really make money from this?"**
A: Yes! Members are making money from:
- Selling games (itch.io, Steam)
- Freelance game dev
- Teaching others
- Game jams with prizes
- Commission work

**Q: "Which game engine should I use?"**
A: Start with web games (HTML5/JavaScript) - no installation needed. Later explore Unity, Godot, or others based on your goals.

**Q: "Is AI just a shortcut? Will I actually learn?"**
A: AI is a tool that lets you learn BY DOING instead of just reading. You'll learn more in 1 week of building with AI than 1 month of traditional tutorials.
