Analyze project dependencies:

1. List all dependencies (production and dev)
2. Identify outdated packages
3. Flag any known security vulnerabilities
4. Suggest which packages are safe to update
5. Warn about any breaking changes in updates
6. Show commands to update packages

Check package.json (Node.js), requirements.txt (Python), Cargo.toml (Rust), or similar files depending on the project type.
