Search the entire codebase for TODO, FIXME, HACK, and XXX comments.

Organize them by:
1. **Priority** (FIXME > TODO > HACK > XXX)
2. **File location**

For each item, show:
- The comment text
- File path and line number
- Surrounding context (a few lines of code)

Suggest which items should be addressed first based on their importance and context.
