Create a git commit for my current changes with a professional commit message.

Steps:
1. Review the current git diff to see what changed
2. Write a clear, descriptive commit message following conventional commit format (feat/fix/docs/etc)
3. Show me the commit message before executing
4. Ask for confirmation before committing

If there are unstaged changes, ask which files to include in the commit.
